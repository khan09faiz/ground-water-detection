[cite_start]This repository contains the project "Identifying Groundwater Potential Zone," submitted in partial fulfillment for the award of the Degree of B.

## üìã Abstract

[cite_start]Groundwater is a critical resource in arid regions like Jodhpur, India[cite: 15, 34]. [cite_start]Due to over-extraction and climate change, its sustainable management has become imperative[cite: 16]. [cite_start]This research presents a machine learning-driven approach to delineate Groundwater Potential Zones (GWPZ) across the administrative boundary of Jodhpur[cite: 17]. [cite_start]Using **52 ground-truth locations** (34 well sites and 18 non-well sites) and **15 influential geospatial and hydrogeological parameters**, we trained and evaluated nine supervised classification algorithms[cite: 18, 20]. [cite_start]Our findings show that ensemble models, particularly **Random Forest (RF)** and **Logistic Regression (LR)**, offer superior accuracy in identifying GWPZs[cite: 22]. [cite_start]A feature importance analysis highlighted that **Rainfall, NDVI, and Proximity to Waterbodies** are the most significant factors influencing groundwater availability[cite: 22]. [cite_start]The final delineated map classifies the region into five zones‚Äî*Very Good, Good, Moderate, Poor, and Very Poor*‚Äîproviding crucial insights for sustainable water resource management and policymaking[cite: 23].

### Influencing Factors (Thematic Layers)

[cite_start]Fifteen thematic layers were used to train the models, representing key topographic, hydrological, geological, and biotic factors[cite: 18, 76].

1.  [cite_start]**Rainfall**: Primary source of groundwater recharge[cite: 99].
2.  [cite_start]**Proximity to Water Bodies (DFR)**: Areas closer to rivers have higher recharge potential[cite: 98].
3.  [cite_start]**Drainage Density (DD)**: Lower density indicates greater recharge capacity[cite: 96].
4.  [cite_start]**Lithology**: Physical rock characteristics influencing porosity and permeability[cite: 100].
5.  [cite_start]**Geomorphology**: Landforms that control water flow and storage[cite: 101].
6.  [cite_start]**Topographical Wetness Index (TWI)**: Quantifies the potential for water accumulation[cite: 96].
7.  [cite_start]**Soil Depth**: Deeper soils offer more storage and enhance percolation[cite: 105].
8.  [cite_start]**Soil Slope**: Influences lateral water movement and infiltration rates[cite: 107].
9.  [cite_start]**Soil Texture**: Determines the proportion of sand, silt, and clay, affecting infiltration[cite: 104].
10. [cite_start]**Forest Cover**: Promotes infiltration and reduces surface runoff[cite: 111].
11. [cite_start]**Hill Shade**: Derived from the DEM to understand topography[cite: 18].
12. [cite_start]**Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**: Indicates vegetation density, which affects infiltration[cite: 109].
13. [cite_start]**Altitude (Elevation/DEM)**: Affects surface runoff and gravitational potential for recharge[cite: 94].
14. [cite_start]**Land Use/Land Cover (LULC)**: Categorizes human impact on groundwater systems[cite: 113].
15. [cite_start]**Slope**: Steepness of the ground surface, controlling runoff vs. infiltration[cite: 95].
