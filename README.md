## üìã Abstract

Groundwater is a critical resource in arid regions like Jodhpur, India. Due to over-extraction and climate change, its sustainable management has become imperative. This research presents a machine learning-driven approach to delineate Groundwater Potential Zones (GWPZ) across the administrative boundary of Jodhpur. Using **52 ground-truth locations** (34 well sites and 18 non-well sites) and **15 influential geospatial and hydrogeological parameters**, we trained and evaluated nine supervised classification algorithms. Our findings show that ensemble models, particularly **Random Forest (RF)** and **Logistic Regression (LR)**, offer superior accuracy in identifying GWPZs. A feature importance analysis highlighted that **Rainfall, NDVI, and Proximity to Waterbodies** are the most significant factors influencing groundwater availability. The final delineated map classifies the region into five zones‚Äî*Very Good, Good, Moderate, Poor, and Very Poor*‚Äîproviding crucial insights for sustainable water resource management and policymaking.

### **Influencing Factors (Thematic Layers)**

Fifteen thematic layers were used to train the models, representing key topographic, hydrological, geological, and biotic factors.

1.  **Rainfall**: Primary source of groundwater recharge.
2.  **Proximity to Water Bodies (DFR)**: Areas closer to rivers have higher recharge potential.
3.  **Drainage Density (DD)**: Lower density indicates greater recharge capacity.
4.  **Lithology**: Physical rock characteristics influencing porosity and permeability.
5.  **Geomorphology**: Landforms that control water flow and storage.
6.  **Topographical Wetness Index (TWI)**: Quantifies the potential for water accumulation.
7.  **Soil Depth**: Deeper soils offer more storage and enhance percolation.
8.  **Soil Slope**: Influences lateral water movement and infiltration rates.
9.  **Soil Texture**: Determines the proportion of sand, silt, and clay, affecting infiltration.
10. **Forest Cover**: Promotes infiltration and reduces surface runoff.
11. **Hill Shade**: Derived from the DEM to understand topography.
12. **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**: Indicates vegetation density, which affects infiltration.
13. **Altitude (Elevation/DEM)**: Affects surface runoff and gravitational potential for recharge.
14. **Land Use/Land Cover (LULC)**: Categorizes human impact on groundwater systems.
15. **Slope**: Steepness of the ground surface, controlling runoff vs. infiltration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology and Code Explained üíª

This project leverages a combination of geospatial analysis tools and Python-based machine learning libraries to process data and build predictive models.

### **Technology Stack**

* **QGIS 3.34**: An open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) used for all spatial data preprocessing, including re-projecting, clipping, and raster analysis to derive factors like slope, drainage density, and TWI.
* **Python**: The core programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
* **Scikit-learn**: A fundamental library for implementing machine learning models, including RandomForest, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and for performing evaluations like train-test splits and cross-validation.
* **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, primarily for handling the structured dataset extracted from the geospatial layers.
* **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations that underpins many of the data science libraries used.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for data visualization, including plotting feature importance, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

### **Code Walkthrough (`ground water.ipynb`)**

The Jupyter Notebook provided contains the end-to-end workflow for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

1.  **Library Imports**: The first cell imports all necessary libraries for model building, data handling, and visualization.

2.  **Data Loading and Cleaning**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (`gw 34.csv`) into a Pandas DataFrame.The code checks for missing values using `.isna().sum()` and handles them using spline interpolation (`.interpolate()`), which is a method for estimating missing data points by fitting a smooth curve.

3.  **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`, 'Potential')[cite: 38]. [cite_start]`train_test_split` from Scikit-learn is used to create training and testing sets.The `stratify=y` argument is crucial as it ensures that the proportion of well sites to non-well sites is the same in both the training and testing sets, which is important for imbalanced datasets.

4. **Feature Scaling**: A `StandardScaler` is initialized to standardize the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This step is important for models that are sensitive to the scale of input features, such as SVC, Logistic Regression, and MLP.

5.  **Model Training and Evaluation**: Several classification models are trained on the data:
    * **Random Forest**: An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
    * **Gradient Boosting & AdaBoost**: Both are boosting algorithms that build models sequentially, where each new model corrects the errors of the previous one.
    * **Decision Tree**: A single tree model that makes decisions based on feature splits.
    * **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its 'k' nearest neighbors.
    * **Logistic Regression**: A linear model used for binary classification.
    * **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: Finds the hyperplane that best separates the two classes in the feature space.
    * **Na√Øve Bayes (GaussianNB, BernoulliNB)**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
    * **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: A feedforward artificial neural network.

6.  **Feature Importance Analysis**: After training the Random Forest classifier, the `.feature_importances_` attribute is used to determine which factors had the most significant impact on the model's predictions.These importances are then visualized using a horizontal bar chart, providing clear insights into the key drivers of groundwater potential.

7. **Performance Visualization**: The notebook generates confusion matrices and ROC curves for the models to visually assess their performance, showing how well they distinguish between "Potential" and "No Potential" zones.
